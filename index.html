    <h2>I am a second semester senior studying English Writing with a focus in poetry and Public and Professional Writing. Over the past four years I have enjoyed taking a wide variety of course. There is no set type of class I have liked the best but rather I enjoy the classes where professors care about what they are teaching. I find the excitement and engagement to be infectious. My writing tries to explore what it means to be human and how we all can strive to be more human.

    <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product
      development? </h1>
    <h2>As a writer I constantly think about the usability of my documents. When it comes to professional writing I am consciously thinking about how to create the most usable document. It is from this that I thought it might be useful to actually understand usability in a broader sense. This will allow me to move beyond just writing in my work and expand my future potential. However, I have a more personal relationship with the concept of usability, especially when it comes to written text. As a poet I often play with the overall usability of my art to create meaning and purposeful confusion. So this class will also provide me with a greater understanding of just how to manipulate usability to create a variety of outcomes.
